To run the following project on your local machine please follow below instructions:

1. Git Clone - https://github.com/Sagar-Deshmukh-personal/Sagar-Deshmukh-personal-Risk_Governance_API_Automation.git
   For understanding purpose I have kept target folder consisting of reports but in ideal use case when committing code 'target/' folder is excluded

2. Use following command in terminal:
    - mvn clean install
    - mvn test "-Dkarate.options=--tags @sanity"
3. Test reports will be generated inside folder '/target' open the same in browser to review
    - Cucumber report - /target/cucumber-html-reports/overview-features.html
    - Basic karate report - /target/karate-reports/karate-summary.html
4. The report will demonstarte table 'Scenarios' - Pass/Fail v/s the Feature and it will aslo display the same for 'No. of steps for those scenarios'
   Click on the feature file to read detailed steps and execution output
